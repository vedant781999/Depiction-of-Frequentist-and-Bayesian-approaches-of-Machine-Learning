# Depiction-of-Frequentist-and-Bayesian-approaches-of-Machine-Learning
It depicts the difference between Frequentist and Bayesian approaches of Machine Learning by analyzing the output probabilities from both approaches.

A dataset of 160 observations on an experiment is taken.

Frequentist Approach is applied on an experiment to calculate the outcome of that experiment. The Maximum Likelihood Distribution for the approach is taken as Bernoulli Distribution. The Maximum Likelihood Estimator , Mean of the experiment is observed to be 0.61.

Bayesian Approach is applied on the same experiment with given domain knowledge. The prior distribution of the experiment is known to be a Beta Distribution. Now, with Sequential Learning Posterior Probability is calculated as the product of prior and likelihood probabilities.
